# vget
Wrapper around svtplay-dl and ffmpeg

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

vget are using 
* [svtplay-dl](https://github.com/spaam/svtplay-dl)
* [ffmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg)
Hence, they both need to be installed for vget to work.

### Installing

```
/usr/local/bin/ or ~/bin/
```
Don't forget to make it executable
```
chmod +x vget
```
